ezWeb v0.1.1 - (C) by P. Giebel <spam@stimpyrama.org>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


WHAT IS EZWEB?

 ezWeb is a webinterface for use with ezStream 
 (http://www.icecast.org/ezstream.php).


WHAT CAN IT DO?

 - Add a managable queue to ezStream
 - Add track weightings
 - Manage "cron-jobs" (play different collections at different times..)


HOW TO USE?

 Just follow the installation instructions at the file "INSTALL" and visit
 the webinterface with your browser.. It's pretty much self-explanatory.
 If you don't know what something means, just point on it with your mouse
 and you'll get a short explanation..

 After adding new tracks to a collection, you'll need to run "dbupdate.php"
 via shell:
   #~> php dbupdate.php


WHAT'S TO COME?

 Well.. This is no "real" project of mine.. I just needed something like
 that - it was easy to code - so I did..
 I still have some Ideas, but we'll see when I'll add them.. ;)
 So if you want to add features (or even bugfixes..!) - feel free, as long
 as you don't remove the copyright-tags and send the patches to me..


LICENSE?

 BSD...


HELP?

 Well.... ;) As I said before: This is no real project of mine.. Of course
 you can always ask any question you want, but don't expect 24/7 support
 (or even an own homepage.. ;)
 You can reach me via email: spam@stimpyrama.org
 Or via IRC: irc.freenode.net - #eclectix (I'm stimpy...)
