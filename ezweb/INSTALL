ezWeb v0.1.1 installation instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREQUISITES

 - ezStream (http://www.icecast.org/ezstream.php)
 - Apache (http://httpd.apache.org)
 - PHP (-apache AND -cli) (http://www.php.net)
 - PEAR::DB


INSTALLATION

1. Move all files into a web-accessable directory on your server
2. Edit config-file (data/include/config.inc.php.sample)
   and rename it to "config.inc.php"
3. Now you CAN (and SHOULD) move the files "poll.php" and "dbupdate.php"
   into another, not web-accessable directory.
4. Edit "poll.php" and "dbupdate.php": In the very beginning of both
   files, there's a line looking kind of like that:
     $webdir = "/path/to/ezweb/";
   edit it so the path points to your ezweb web-root-dir.
5. If you can, create a new SQL-DB for ezweb and grant permissions to a 
   new user (e.g. "ezwebuser") - if you can't, use a SQL-DB and a User
   you already have..
6. Create the DB-structure using the SQL-Dumps contained with this
   archive:
     #~> mysql -u <username> -p <db-name> < dbinit.sql
   e.g:
     #~> mysql -u ezwebuser -p ezweb < dbinit.sql
7. Visit your new ezWeb-installation with your browser: You'll
   see a lot of empty windows - click on "add" at the "collection-
   window" to create your first collection.
   Collections are different sets of mp3s, so you can easily manage
   different rotations for different times.
   The path, you'll be asked for, has to be relative to the "mp3dir"
   you set at the config-file...
8. Run "dbupdate.php" via shell: "php dbupdate.php"
9. Run "poll.php" once via shell: "php poll.php"
10. Edit your ezstream configuration so it uses the ezweb poller:
    Somewhere in your ezstream-config, you'll find a line:
      <filename>foobar</filename>
    foobar normally is a text-file containing all your mp3s, but it can
    also be a script:
      <filename>/path/to/your/poll.php</filename>
11. (Re)start ezstream
